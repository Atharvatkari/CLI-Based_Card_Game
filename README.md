## CLI-Based Card Game: 5-3-2 

## Overview
This is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) implementation of the popular 5-3-2 card game, developed in both JavaScript and Java. The project demonstrates core programming concepts like data structures, game logic, and user input handling in a multiplayer card game environment. The 5-3-2 card game is a trick-taking game typically played with three players and a standard 52-card deck (no Jokers). This implementation supports dynamic turn management, scoring, and trick collection, providing an engaging gameplay experience through the terminal.

## Features
1. Multiplayer Gameplay: Supports 3 players with randomly distributed cards.
2. Turn Management: Players take turns sequentially, with invalid moves prompting replays.
3. Trick-Winner Logic: Determines the winner of each trick based on card ranks and suits.
4. Score Tracking: Displays scores after each round and calculates the final winner.
5. Dynamic Starting Player: The winner of each trick leads the next round, ensuring fair gameplay.
6. Error Handling: Handles edge cases, such as players running out of cards.

## Technology Stack
1. JavaScript: For flexible scripting and quick prototyping.
2. Java: For robust, scalable implementation with object-oriented design.
   
Both implementations emphasize efficient use of data structures for performance and readability.

## How to Play
1. Run the game in your terminal.
2. Players input valid cards on their turn.
3. The player with the highest card in a round wins the trick.
4. Play continues until all cards are used.
